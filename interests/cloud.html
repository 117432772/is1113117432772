        	<div class="section" id="section2c"><h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:georgia;">What is Cloud computing?</h2><p>Cloud computing can be defined as the practice of storing regularly used computer data on multiple servers that can be accessed through the Internet</p><p>In plain terms,cloud computing is the self-provisioning and on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications over the Internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.</p></div>
        	<div class="section" id="section3c"><h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:georgia;">How and When I Use Cloud Services</h2>Like most people,I use cloud services day-to-day.One example of this is social media.From the outset,the main role of social media is to connect people and engage in the social aspect of the internet.Nonetheless, I simultaneously use cloud services such as Public APIs (application programming interfaces) maintained by social media websites. For example when I take a picture on my smartphone, it is stored on my phone's internal memory drive. However, when I upload the photos to Instagram, I am uploading it to the cloud. Therefore I use Cloud services quite frequently by Uploading content to Snapchat,Twitter,Facebook and Instagram daily.<p>For college work , I use SaaS applications such as Microsoft's Office 365, which allows the possibility for my work to becomes portable, safe and accessible no matter where I am, without the need for me to save my data onto a USB key or device.</p><p>PaaS (platform as a service) is an essential Cloud Service for me when it comes to my college work. I use PaaS applications such as Heroku to develop projects in an online platform and launch them onto the internet itself. Without this service a lot of my project work simply could not possibly be completed.</p></div>
            <div class="section" id="section4c"><h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:georgia;">How Cloud Services Benefit Me</h2><p>Collaboration in group projects is a big advantage for me as a student. Cloud computing means during projects, it is possible for all group members to access the documents at all times from different devices and computers, so instead of one person being responsible for owning the document, it becomes a group effort, where each person can be held accountable for each individual piece of work they produce. </p>
            <p>Another reason is the mobility cloud services provide me with in my work. Services like Google Drive and apple icloud allow me to access my work files via my mobile phone, campus computer or any other device. This allows me to make better use of my free time during travel, lunchbreaks and during college hours as  I can access my student information, and any other important documents, on my smartphone or laptop with an easy user interface and various web platforms. </p>
            <p>The physical benefit of Cloud Services to me is the reduced textbook weight I would have to carry around college on a daily basis. I can download ebooks and upload project files to be submitted to my lecturers on the cloud , using web applications like Blackboard and Google Drive. This is beneficial financially (savings on printing costs etc.) and from the aspect of health as I won't need to carry around large books.</p></div>
